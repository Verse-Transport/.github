## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

#### Welcome to the Verse Transport GitHub.
Currently, the source code for Verse Transport is not avaliable, there are no plans to make it public in the future.
We are however are considering working on an API that will allow you to access the same data that we either generate or collect that we display on our website.

> [!NOTE]
> Auckland is the only region avaliable at the moment.
